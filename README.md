To view the project, simply open the main.html file in a web browser.

I developed this project using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Additionally, I incorporated a small PHP component to demonstrate my proficiency in working with server-side technologies. 
Specifically, I created a form submission functionality using the POST method. 
However, it's important to note that the form submission is unlikely to work as intended, as it requires further configuration and server-side processing.

For the image slider functionality, I used the Swiper library. The modal window, which contains the contact form, is triggered and displayed using JavaScript.

Also, I tried to optimize the website for various devices and screen sizes.
